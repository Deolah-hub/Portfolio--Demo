  # Portfolio Website (Beginner Project)

This repository contains a **screen recording** of a website I built during my early web development journey. While this was one of my first projects, it helped me strengthen my skills 

# About the Project
- This project showcases a **full website layout** with responsive design elements.
- The website includes:
  - Navigation menu
  - Products section
  - Basic interactive elements
  - Styled content sections

> Note: This was an earlier project. I have since continued developing my skills and can create more advanced and dynamic web applications.


## Screen Recording
The screen recording demonstrates the complete website in action.
